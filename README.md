# Restaurant Page
## About
- The purpose of this project was to make a restaurant page with 'tabs'
- The tabs would be focused on commonly seen nav items such as menu and contact
- This project was completed as part of the odin project js curriculum
- It was made with JS, SASS, HTML, Webpack and NPM
- [Live Preview](https://tobiaoy.github.io/restaurant-page/)

## Retrospective
- This project was the first time I've used webpack and I initially struggled with its configuration
- However after testing some ideas, I came to appreciate the separation of JS files
- I also opted to use SASS over traditional CSS to learn the preprocessor
